# temporal-lens-server

## **NOTICE: WORK IN PROGRESS**

Temporal Lens is **still under development** and should not be used for now.

## What is Temporal Lens?

Temporal Lens is a telemetry infrastructure for Rust. Inspired by wolfpld's [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy), it is designed essentially for game
engine profiling. It consists in three projects :

 * [temporal-lens](https://github.com/temporal-lens-team/temporal-lens), a dependency you add to the Rust project you want to profile
 * [temporal-lens-server](https://github.com/temporal-lens-team/temporal-lens-server), an application that receives data from the `temporal-lens` library via IPC mechanisms, stores it internally, and exposes it to clients such as `temporal-lens-vscode` through a RESTful API
 * [temporal-lens-vscode](https://github.com/temporal-lens-team/temporal-lens-vscode), a Visual Studio Code extension which acquires the data recorded by `temporal-lens-server` and displays it as user-friendly graphs directly inside a vscode tab

## What is this specific git repository about?

`temporal-lens-vscode` is the official client for `temporal-lens-server`. It retrieves data from the server and displays it as meaningful graphs in a vscode tab.
